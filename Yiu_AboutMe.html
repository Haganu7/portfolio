  <h6>Hey, my name is Hagan Yiu and this is my website! My favorite superhero is
  Batman and like watching movies. (DC>Marvel)
  
  <h6>If I have a specific goal in my mind that I am interested in I will 
  dedicate a large amount of time into whatever that thing is until it is 
  completed. I don't like leaving things unfinished and will try to finish it 
  all at once. This is how I do most things like when I write essays, do 
  homework, and reading. I also consider myself an analytical person. I often 
  over think things and tend to stay on topics that have past. This helps me 
  make big decisions but it also can be rather distracting. Whether of not you 
  would consider this a positive trait is up to you.</h6>
  
  <h6>If I'm being completely honest, so far my high school career has been 
  rather uneventful and I have yet to really accomplish anything that is worth
  remembering. (Except maybe this website. Though it is simple I am still quite
  proud of it.) One thing about me is that I like games. Any type of game 
  whether is be a video game, a sport, or even board games. From these games you
  can really learn a lot about team work, planning ahead, and how to adapt to 
  new things.</h6>
  
  <h6>One thing I've always had trouble with is how to end pieces of writing.
  I never know if I should be be honest or professional, so for this one I'm 
  gonna try both. So thank you for checking out my website and reading through 
  all that. Feel free to check out anything else on my website and check back 
  often because I don't plan to stop updating my website any time soon.</h6>
