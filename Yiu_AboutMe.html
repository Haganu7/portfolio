  <h6>Hey, my name is Hagan Yiu and this is my website! Computer science has 
  always interested me to some extent due to its reach into our every day lives
  as well as the possibilities it gives to the future of humanity. While I 
  really do like computer science I'm not completely sure I want to make a 
  career out of it. I'm still not sure what I want to do in the future but 
  anything related to computer science is certainly an option. If I due end up 
  pusuing this path I would want to create something new that I could show the 
  world and maybe even make it better. I guess as any other human, I would like 
  to leave my mark on the world in the time that I have.
  
  <h6>If I have a specific goal in my mind that I am interested in I will 
  dedicate a large amount of time into whatever that thing is until it is 
  completed. I don't like leaving things unfinished and will try to finish it 
  all at once. This is how I do most things like when I write essays, do 
  homework, and reading. I also consider myself an analytical person. I often 
  over think things and tend to stay on topics that have past. This helps me 
  make big decisions but it also can be rather distracting. Whether of not you 
  would consider this a positive trait is up to you.</h6>
  
  <h6>If I'm being completely honest, so far my high school career has been 
  rather uneventful and I have yet to really accomplish anything that is worth
  remembering. (Except maybe this website. Though it is simple I am still quite
  proud of it.) One thing about me is that I like games. Any type of game 
  whether is be a video game, a sport, or even board games. From these games you
  can really learn a lot about team work, planning ahead, and how to adapt to 
  new things. All these skills can be incorporated into computer science and I 
  think they can help a lot.</h6>
  
  <h6>One thing I've always had trouble with is how to end a piece of writing.
  I never know if I should be be honest or professional so for this one I'm 
  gonna try both. So thank you for checking out my website and reading through 
  all that! Feel free to check out anything else on my website and check back 
  often because I don't plan to stop updating my website any time soon.</h6>
